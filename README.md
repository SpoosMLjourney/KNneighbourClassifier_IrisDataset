# KNneighbourClassifier_IrisDataset
ris Dataset K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

This repository provides a Python implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm applied to the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic machine learning problem involving classifying iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Â  

Key features:

Data preprocessing: The dataset is loaded, explored, and preprocessed for analysis.
K-Nearest Neighbors: The KNN algorithm is implemented to classify iris flowers based on their features.
Model evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Visualizations are provided to help understand the data and the model's decision boundaries.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
